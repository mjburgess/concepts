    "> The London MET developed the Gang Matrix to identify potential gang members and score them according to the risk they pose to society. Research by Amnesty International (2018) and Scott (2018) revealed the discriminatory nature of this predictive identification program, in which the majority of individuals were young black men. The MET was ordered to radically reform the matrix within a year by the Mayor of London, and are currently working on a new program called the ‘Concern Hub’ (Mayor or London, 2018a: Dodd, 2018; Crisp, 2019). \n",

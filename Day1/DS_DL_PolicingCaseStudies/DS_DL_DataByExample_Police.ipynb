To increase the efficient exchange of police records for criminal activities that fall outside the scope of Europol, several European Member States have successfully lobbied for the creation of EPRIS (Focant et al, 2012). \n",

    "> Administered by Europol, the mandate of EPRIS is to provide police with a quick overview if and where police records on an individual can be found in Europe. As such Europol is developing EPRIS as an INDEX, which allows police forces to search in each other’s databases. The result will be ‘hit’/‘no hit’; in the case of a ‘hit’ the querying members state police department can then go through the proper judicial channels to gain access to the information (Jones, 2011).

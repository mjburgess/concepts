The most common practice of this type of technology in Europe is risk modelling, in which individuals are identified and ranked according to the likelihood they will engage in criminal or violent activity. In the U.K. there are three distinct predictive identification programs in London, Avon and Somerset and the West Midlands (Couchman, 2019; Amnesty International, 2018). The London MET developed the Gang Matrix to identify potential gang members and score them according to the risk they pose to society. "

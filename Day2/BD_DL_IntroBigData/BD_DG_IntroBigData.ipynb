In 2000 when “Big Data” became a term of art, volume was the greatest challenge: 1 TB of data would require a very large number of machines.

This data is duplicated in many places, including within traditional systems, to enable a highly flexible and isolated approach to analytics. \n",

    "Data Analysts are the first fact-finding layer of data recipients. They work with analytical tools (eg., excel) and dashboards (typically built by software engineers). Their job is to summarize and aggregate the relevant datasets they are presented with to answer fact-finding strategic business questions. \n",

    "Data Scientists are the final hire. They are accelerators across all these prior functions: software engineering, data engineering, analytics & insight. They are able to derive the last-mile high-value from these practice areas. They bring to software engineering, intelligent applications; to data engineering, systems which enrich and structure data for greater insight; to analytics, deep explanatory and predictive projects.
